# R-Monitor v2 protocol for serial devices

This is a framework, free to use by anyone who wants. I did a racing semaphore in one of the companies
I worked for and have since liked what I've done. Also am a big fan of racing so I'm giving this
away for free for everyone to use!

## Usage

Simply import the .h files in your app.h and voila, you should be good to go!
